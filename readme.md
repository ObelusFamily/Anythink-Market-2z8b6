# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

## Instructions

1. Open Docker and start its Engine 🚗🚗🚗
2. Using CMD navigate to your cloned repository <https://github.com/ObelusFamily/Anythink-Market-2z8b6.git>
3. In your CMD console run the following command to start the Anythink-Market Engine
   3a) The command is: <code>docker-compose up </code>
4. --WAIT-- ⏳⏳⏳ till it's finished. If everything went correctly and smoothly the CMD window will show up your localhost address along with a port
   4a) Use this to connect to frontend ✅
5. Connect to your backend and check if you get a message. If yes continue to next step. If not ask around 🙄
6. Then connect to the frontend and create an account.
7. After that consult Ness ✔✔✔
